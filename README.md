This is a bot written in python that runs in whatsapp and is purely an extension of [yowsup](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup).

##CAUTION##
Although this used to work fine, I got two numbers banned(?) in late August, 2014. 
So, please be warned.

##Installation##
The installation process is quite simple

#### One Time steps####

    git clone https://github.com/asdofindia/python-whatsapp-bot.git
    cd python-whatsapp-bot
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

#### Associating with account ####
Follow [https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/wiki/yowsup-cli#registration](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/wiki/yowsup-cli#registration) and register a number. After registering you must have created a config file as mentioned [here](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/wiki/yowsup-cli#your-login-credentials) like [this](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/blob/master/src/config.example)
Place the config file in `configs` folder.

## Running the bot ##
    python bot.py -c configs/<yourconfig> -b -a -k
    
if -c is not specified, `configs/config` will be used.

#### Report errors ###
I have tried to use modules that are already available in python. If any missing module error is thrown, try `pip install <modulename>`.
Please [create an issue](https://github.com/asdofindia/python-whatsapp-bot/issues) if you have errors that needs fix

#### Develop modules ####
Read modules in the modules folder and create your own modules. 
If possible teach me python and refactor this mess.
Send pull requests, I'll merge them if I know how to :P

##About
Look at my [older implementation](https://github.com/asdofindia/pyWhatsapp) to know more about how that used to work.
